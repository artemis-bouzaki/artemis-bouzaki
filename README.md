## About Me

🔬 **Research Focus**:  
I am currently pursuing a PhD in Cancer Sciences, where my primary research goal is to create a predictive model for identifying patients at risk of fractures after radiotherapy. By leveraging clinical data, machine learning, and advanced analytics, I aim to provide insights for personalised patient care.

💡 **Previous Experience**:  
- **Research Assistant**: I developed a novel approach for spatial dose analysis and genomic research, enabling a more detailed understanding of the relationship between radiotherapy dose distributions and genetic factors influencing patient outcomes.  
- **CERN (LHCB)**: During my internship at CERN, I worked on the LHCB experiment, analysing vast datasets calculate matter-antimatter asymmetries. This experience honed my skills in managing and interpreting large-scale, complex datasets.  
- **Sustainability and Innovation Projects**: I have also contributed to projects focused on sustainability, such as ZEROPLUS using innovative solutions to tackle real-world problems. These experiences helped me understand how data-driven approaches can address global challenges across industries.


## Skills

- **Programming & Tools**: Python, MATLAB, C++, R
- **Data Science**: Image-based data mining, Statistical analysis, Data visualisation
- **Software Development**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Django, SQL, Git
